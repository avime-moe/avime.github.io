    'question': 'What does it mean to be on-chain encoded?',
    'answer': 'Having our Avime be entirely encoded on-chain means that all the data and images used to create your Avime and their traits live directly on the Ethereum blockchain, attached to our custom built smart contract. This means that there is no requirement for Avime assets to be hosted on services such as IPFS or centralized servers. This means that your Avime is an immortal and native resident of Ethereum that will be backed by the robust security the network can provide.',

    'id': 2,
    'question': 'How are Avime customizable?',
    'answer': 'We created Avime with the intent for everyone to make characters that truly resonate with them. Avime allows you to mix and match your character the way that you want. There will be two smart contracts: an initial minting contract and a fusion contract. When minting, you’ll receive 6 individual Avime Trait Cards required for creating an Avime; a background, body, face, clothes, hair, and accessory. In the Wardrobe, you can preview how traits look with one another and choose whether you want your Avime to be male or female. Each trait is its own ERC721 NFT that can be bought, sold, or traded on the open market. When you’ve collected the traits you want to use, you can fuse them together to mint your Avime! All Trait Cards are burned in the process, and there will only ever be enough traits to create 10k Avime, so choose wisely and make sure your combination is the one you really want. All assets including your finished Avime are stored directly on-chain!',

    'question': 'How much does it cost to mint and fuse?',
    'answer': 'It costs 0.09 ETH for a set of 6 Avime Trait Cards, and each transaction is limited to 10 mints maximum. Using the Wardrobe to create an Avime Fusion will cost .01 ETH.',
  },
  {
    'id': 4,
    'question': 'Will I be able to choose what traits I receive?',
    'answer': 'Upon minting, you will be given 6 randomly generated Avime Trait Cards from each category. Trait Cards have a rarity system which dictates your probability to receive them upon mint. However, you are not required to combine your traits into an Avime upon mint, they will instead be minted into your wallet individually where you can even mix and match with previously minted cards. This means that while you cannot choose the traits you will receive on mint, you will have the flexibility to track down specific traits you want on the open market to create your Avime!',
  },
  {
    'id': 5,
    'question': 'Are you going to add more traits?',
    'answer': 'We definitely plan to add more traits in future updates! Should we reach our roadmap milestone, we will begin production on Avime Season 2. All Avime Trait Cards from this expansion are entirely compatible with Season 1 Trait cards in the Wardrobe, exponentially increasing the amount of available customization options! In order to maintain a maximum cap of 10k total Avime Fusions, an exchange of Season 1 Trait Cards is required for minting those from Season 2 within the same category. Like Season 1 Trait Card, there will be varying degrees of rarity in the expansion set. The rarity of the Season 1 Trait Card burned during the exchange bears no effect on the Season 2 Trait Card received. This means that Common Avime Trait Cards from season 1 have a chance to re-roll into rarer Season 2 traits!',
  },
  {
    'id': 6,
    'question': 'Can someone create the same Avime combination as mine?',
    'answer': 'Due to the ability to choose your own traits, it is possible for someone to copy combinations from others. However, if the Wardrobe detects that the exact combination of traits being used is not unique, you will get a notification prior to fusion. You will not be prevented from creating this fusion however, as it is entirely up to the user’s choice. Note that Avime are serialized in order of when they were created. This means that the first uniquely created Avime combination will always have a lower serialization number than any copies that come after it.',

    'question': 'Can I kiss my Avime?',
    'answer': 'It\'s your Avime. We won\'t judge.',

    'id': 8,
    'question': 'Could you create an Avime trait of my favorite anime character?',
    'answer': 'We respect the intellectual properties of other creators and believe the future of Avime would be jeopardized should we add traits that directly copy from already existing works. While we will not create direct copies of character traits, we take inspiration from a wide variety of anime, video games, and other media to create original designs that capture the aesthetic of various popular characters and tropes.',
